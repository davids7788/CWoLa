# CWoLa
Short version of my Master Thesis project coding

Please note, that the Jupyter Notebook in this repository is NOT meant to be perfectly
optimzed in terms of processing speed, memory usage, etc. It will only provide a 
shortened version of my Master Thesis project coding. There might still be some issues, but 
it should run through everything.

Note that the working directory has to contain the following files:
- This Jupyter Notebook
- The folder img
- The folder Thesis_data_after_preselection

## CWoLa GAN

This is just a very first try to explore GAN, but maybe a CWoLa GAN would be fun and usefull if one isn't able to provide labeled
data... If the discriminator might learn the original thing ( like ttbar vs.QCD ) and discriminates them against fakes...
